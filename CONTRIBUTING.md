Thank you for your interest in contributing to the vATIS project!

## Contributions

All contributions to this project should be made in the form of a GitHub pull request. Each pull request will be reviewed by the project owner. If the contribution is deemed to be beneficial, it will either be merged in or presented with feedback for changes that would be required. All accepted contributions will be licensed under [GPLv3](LICENSE).

## Getting started

The first thing you should do is search through the [issues](https://github.com/vatis-project/vatis/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/vatis-project/vatis/pulls) to see if someone else had a similar idea or question.

Next, learn how to build the project by reading the [local development documentation](https://vatis.app/docs/client/local-development).

Contributions should be made using a GitHub pull request to provide a clean way for commenting and revising of proposed changes.

1. Create a  [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.
2. `Fork` the project repository by clicking the **Fork** button on top right of the repository page.
3. `Clone` your forked repository `git clone https://github.com/vatis-project/vatis.git`
4. Add a new feature branch `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
5. Make changes to the code and commit them locally (your commit message should describe what the changes are)
6. Push your new branch to your fork on GitHub `git push -u origin my-feature-branch`
7. From your forked GitHub repository, open a pull request in the branch that contains your contributions. If you need to add additional commits to your pull request, you can commit the changes to your local branch and then use the `git push` command to automatically update your pull request.
8. At this point, your contribution has been submitted for review. Any comments about your contribution will be posted in the pull request.
9. If your contributions are approved, your pull request will be merged into the main project.
